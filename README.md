# FilmQueryProject

# Description
This project has access to various tables within a database that include films, actors, and languages. Using this program you are able to enter in any ID to access a film, which will then display its release year, rating, run time, description, title, id, language, and actors. Their is also another function to search through all of the films title's and description's, to find a film that matches the user keyword. If no match is found the program tells you that their is no match found.  
# Technologies Used
Git, Terminal, Mysql, Eclipse, Java
# Lessons Learned
In this project I learned how to interact with databases using mysql commands. I also learned how to interact with databases within java while using mysql commands so that the user can just interact with the program as opposed to downloading the database for themselves. I also learned how to communicate between different tables to turn a numbered table value to its corresponding string value, ie language_id to language.name.
